# The Problem

Medical records are trapped in separate systems that don't communicate. This fragmentation leaves patients and doctors struggling to coordinate care across multiple disconnected platforms, while growing political and economic uncertainty in healthcare demands greater autonomy from large institutions. Modern health data now extends beyond traditional medical records to include information from wearable devices and personal health technology. As artificial intelligence becomes part of healthcare, patients need a secure way to control their complete health information and choose how it's used. A solution is needed that puts patients in charge while ensuring their data can flow seamlessly between healthcare providers and systems.

# Our Mission

HIE of One offers a free, open-source, patient-controlled alternative to the standard electronic health record. We feel that patient-controlled data is essential to safety and good health. HIE of One's Trustee Community is designed to foster the assembly of patients and Clinicians with common interests and motives without the involvement of large institutions, corporations, and similar monoliths. Our platform integrates with major healthcare systems, electronic health records, and consumer health apps, enabling both providers and patients to consolidate and manage health information from multiple sources in one secure, patient-controlled environment.

## Key Differentiators

- **Open Source:** This is a community driven development effort. If you are a developer and want to participate or read more about the software, please [visit us on GitHub](https://github.com/HIEofOne).

- **Decentralized:** Decentralized services provide a freedom and utility that will, ultimately, change the way software is built. As a strong proponent of community driven software development, we believe that the decentralized nature of our service makes it uniquely better suited to serve healthcare. While HIE does not need wide adoption in order to succeed, we do hope to be enough of a force to encourage standards adoption from large vendors.

- **Sovereign:** AI will undoubtedly change some aspects of healthcare. Rather than sit in judgment of this, HIE seeks to foster meaningful and responsible interaction between AI and EHRs. It is essential that patients have control over their data, and doctors over their notes and teaching files, so they can take responsibility for their interactions with AI. As with any tool, the outcome depends on how itâ€™s used, and while accountability in AI isn't widely discussed today, it will become a key issue as its role in healthcare grows.

Now that you know where we stand, here's the better news: it works! This whole product is in beta, but you can experiment with all aspects of open source EHR's today. Here's how:
