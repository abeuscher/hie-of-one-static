# Our Mission

HIE of One offers an open-source, patient-controlled alternative to the standard electronic health record. We feel that patient-controlled data is essential to safety and good health. HIE of One's Trustee Community is designed to foster the assembly of patients and healthcare providers with common interests and motives without the involvement of large institutions, corporations, and similar monoliths.

## Key Differentiators

- **Open Source:** This is a community driven development effort. If you are a developer and want to participate or read more about the software, please [visit us on GitHub](https://github.com/HIEofOne).

- **Decentralized:** Decentralized services provide a freedom and utility that will, ultimately, change the way software is built. As a strong proponent of community driven software development, we believe that the decentralized nature of our service makes it uniquely better suited to serve healthcare. While HIE does not need wide adoption in order to succeed, we do hope to be enough of a force to encourage standards adoption from large vendors.

- **Sovereign:** AI will undoubtedly change some aspects of healthcare. Rather sit in judgment of this, HIE seeks to foster meaningful and responsible interaction between AI and EHRs. It is essential that patients have control over their data, and doctors over their notes and teaching files, so they can take responsibility for their interactions with AI. As with any tool, the outcome depends on how itâ€™s used, and while accountability in AI isn't widely discussed today, it will become a key issue as its role in healthcare grows.

Now that you know where we stand, here's the better news: it works! This whole product is in beta, but you can experiment with all aspects of open source EHR's today. Here's how:

### How HIE of One Supports Your Practice

Trustee and NOSH aim to offer an alternative for managing patient EHRs in your practice. They could offer some of the following aadvantages:

1. **Patient-Controlled Data:** HIE of One gives patients ownership of their health data while allowing clinicians to retain their teaching files.

2. **Interoperable and Flexible:** Built for easy data exchange, HIE of One connects across different systems, allowing collaboration without proprietary restrictions. By supporting open standards, our model shows that interoperability in healthcare is not only possible but essential.

3. **Responsible AI Use:** HIE of One allows for ethical AI integration, keeping control in the hands of clinicians. Here, AI tools are kept transparent and accountable, enabling you to leverage technology in a way that respects both patient autonomy and professional oversight.

By using HIE of One, you support a patient-centered, open future in healthcare, focused on autonomy, transparency, and collaboration.
