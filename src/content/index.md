# Our Mission

HIE of One offers an open-source, patient-controlled alternative to the standard electronic health record. We feel that patient-controlled data is essential to safety and good health. HIE of One’s Trustee Community is designed to foster the assembly of patients and healthcare providers with common interests and motives without the involvement of large institutions, corporations, and similar monoliths.

The key differentiators to our approach are:

- **Open Source:** This is a community driven development effort. If you are a developer and want to participate or read more about the software, please visit us on github.

- **Decentralized:** Decentralized services provide a freedom and utility that will, ultimately, change the way software is built. As a strong proponent of community driven software development, we believe that the decentralized nature of our service makes it uniquely better suited to serve healthcare. While HIE does not need wide adoption in order to succeed, we don’t mean to be an alternative \- we mean to be the primary solution. Read more.

- **Sovereign:** It is evident that LLMs (AI) are going to change some aspects of healthcare. Rather than sit in judgment of this, HIE seeks to facilitate interaction between LLMs and EHRs as a matter of discovery. To avoid many of the pitfalls of this space, we feel that sovereign control of patients over their information, and of doctors over their teaching files and notes, are critical to the next evolution in healthcare. For more on why, read this.

Now that you know where we stand, here’s the better news: it works\! This whole product is in beta, but you can experiment with all aspects of open source EHR’s today. Here’s how:

## Patients

**Hands on Demo**  
Learn how to set up your EHR and experiment with looking through your health data in an AI assisted framework. Or if it makes you more comfortable, you can load in synthetic records to see how it all works without involving your info.

## Healthcare Providers

**Hands on Demo**  
**Connect with Us**  
Learn more about how Trustee and NOSH offer an alternative for your practice to handle EHR’s. We have a growing community of healthcare providers who are interested in putting our products into trials. Connect and share your own experiences.
