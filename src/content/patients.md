# Take Control of Your Health Records

Have you ever needed to share your medical history with a new doctor, a family member, or a caregiver, only to find yourself either unable to or filling out the same forms over and over again? Have you ever wanted easy access to all your health information in one place? The Trustee ® gateway from HIE of One puts you in control of your complete health record.

## What Trustee Does For You

- **All Your Records in One Place:** Gather your medical history, prescriptions, test results, doctor’s notes, and information from insurance, your wearables or personal health tech in a single, secure location that you control.
- **Easy Sharing with Clinicians :** Share your health information with new doctors or specialists without the hassle of paperwork.
- **Your Data, Your Choices:** Decide exactly what information to share, and with whom. Backup and restore your gathered health records to your computer in standard formats that don’t lock-you-in.
