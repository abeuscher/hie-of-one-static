# Terms of Service

### Updated November 8, 2024

Trustee® is free, open source software hosted as a non-commercial demonstration of leading standards for patient control of their own health records including SMART on FHIR and BlueButton 2.0.

As an open source, free and non-commercial service to the community, use of HIE of One technology and materials is entirely at the user’s risk.

HIE of One software, is public open source on GitHub, is open for inspection by anyone and, although we take efforts to secure patient data, there is a possibility that others will find vulnerabilities in the open source code and exploit them to breach security and privacy.

Use of HIE of One for any purpose other than assembling and controlled sharing of one’s personal health information is prohibited. We reserve the right to terminate any accounts for any reason.

Our open source licenses encourage experimentation and the creation of derivative works by individuals, communities, and institutions anywhere in the world. We take no responsibility for unlicensed derivatives of HIE of One and do not allow unlicensed use of the Trustee registered trademark.
