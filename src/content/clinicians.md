# How HIE of One Supports Your Practice

Trustee and NOSH aim to offer an alternative for managing patient EHRs in your practice. They could offer some of the following aadvantages:

1. **Patient-Controlled Data:** HIE of One gives patients ownership of their health data while allowing clinicians to retain their teaching files.

2. **Interoperable and Flexible:** Built for easy data exchange, HIE of One connects across different systems, allowing collaboration without proprietary restrictions. By supporting open standards, our model shows that interoperability in healthcare is not only possible but essential.

3. **Responsible AI Use:** HIE of One allows for ethical AI integration, keeping control in the hands of clinicians. Here, AI tools are kept transparent and accountable, enabling you to leverage technology in a way that respects both patient autonomy and professional oversight.

By using HIE of One, you support a patient-centered, open future in healthcare, focused on autonomy, transparency, and collaboration.

After [trying the demo](/demo/), we encourage you to [connect with us](mailto:hieofone.org) to discuss how HIE of One can benefit your practice and patients.
