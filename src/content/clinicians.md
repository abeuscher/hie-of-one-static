# How HIE of One Supports Your Practice

The HIE of One Trustee standards-based data access gateway and the NOSH open-source charting system offer an alternative for managing consolidated patient information from EHRs, wearables, and personal health technology. They offer some of the following advantages:

1. **Patient-Controlled Data:** HIE of One gives patients ownership of their health data while allowing clinicians to retain their teaching files and control their own AI.

2. **Interoperable and Flexible:** Built for easy data exchange, HIE of One connects across different systems, allowing collaboration without proprietary restrictions. By supporting open standards, our model shows that interoperability in healthcare is not only possible but essential.

3. **Responsible AI Use:** HIE of One allows for ethical AI integration, keeping control in the hands of clinicians. Here, proprietary AI tools are kept substitutable and, as open source AI technology evolves, transparent and accountable, enabling you to leverage technology in a way that respects both patient autonomy and professional oversight.

By using HIE of One, you support a patient-centered, open future in healthcare, focused on autonomy, transparency, and collaboration. You also support a future where you practice and benefit based on your reputation and minimize the moral injury of intrusive corporate mandates.
