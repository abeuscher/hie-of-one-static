# Patient Demo

HIE of One offers an open-source, patient-controlled alternative to the standard electronic health record. We feel that patient-controlled data is essential to safety and good health. HIE of Oneâ€™s Trustee Community is designed to foster the assembly of patients and healthcare providers with common interests and motives without the involvement of large institutions, corporations, and similar monoliths.
